This repository contains Python code developed to model neutron star structure by solving the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) equations, which represent the hydrostatic equilibrium solution in general relativity. The code is further extended to obtain the neutron star sequence and generate the mass-radius curve.

**Key Features:**
           **Neutron Star Structure Construction:** Solves the TOV equations to model neutron star structure.
           **Neutron Star Sequence:** Generates a sequence of neutron stars for varying central densities.
            **Mass-Radius Curve:** Plots the mass-radius relationship for neutron stars, useful for comparing with observational data.

Additionally, the repository includes work on the thermal evolution of neutron stars. This aspect focuses on the analysis of observational data related to the temperature and age of neutron stars, with an emphasis on identifying outliers—neutron stars that are old yet remain thermally hot, deviating from the expected cooling scenarios.
