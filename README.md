Neutron stars structure is modeled by solving the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) equations, which are hydrostatic equilibrium solution in general relativity.
Developed python code to construct the neutron stars, and also extended this code to obtain the neutron star sequence and mass-radius curve. 
The associated code and plots are listed in this repository.

Also, focused on thermal evolution of neutron stars, wherein dealt with observational data temperature and age of neutron stars. 
Figured out the outliers, the neutron stars which are old yet thermally hot, and don't seem to obey the traditional neutron star cooling scenario.
The plot of outliers is listed in this repository.
